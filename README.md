Challenge-Four

## Description

For this challenge, I had to make a coding quiz. This quiz took me a while to complete because I had to do a lot of research and studying to make sure it would come out wonderful. But all of that quiz asks a couple of simple questions to see your knowledge of coding. Then to see how you fared against others I implemented a scoreboard to show the other participant's scores.
## Getting Started

So first I started off with sudo coding it out was much needed. Then I started to set variables. After I set some global vars I then grabbed some questions and put them in an array. In that array I gave the question, answers, and correct answer. After that I started making the quiz begin. Then once they begin the questions will populate and they will be able to choose an answer. If they are wrong they will have time/score deducted and It will then say wrong answer and move on to the next question. Once all the questions have been asked it will then populate an all done screen and create a box to enter your initials to put on the scoreboard. Once you click the submit button then the scoreboard will appear and will have a list of people and their scores.
